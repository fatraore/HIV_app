# HIV app

This HIV app provides an overwiew of HIV epidemic. The app is built with R using shiny framework and can easily be reproduced by others. The code behind the app is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fatraore/HIV_app) on MIT license.

I made this application to apply for a job offer and show my skills in R programming and Shiny application.
